  <p>Once your feet are equipped with the proper athletic footwear, step one is perfecting your foot strike. Your “foot strike,” or the position in which your foot lands on each step, is a hotly contested subject in the running community. Human Kinetics, for example, advocates the use of a mid-foot strike. However, the minimalist running craze ignited by the author of Born to Run, Christopher McDougall, swears by a forefoot strike that mimics running barefoot like our ancestors.

        Whether you choose to strike your midfoot or forefoot comes down to preference and comfort. Learn more about foot strikes here.</p>

  <h2 id="Training Tactics">Training Tactics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Start off slow: </strong>Don't worry about your pace.  Speed will come in time</li>
    <li><strong>Start with one mile or less: </strong> Do not push yourself to do longer distances than your body can handle.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Get a good pair of running shoes: </strong>Injuries can happen more frequently if you do not have the correct pair of runnng shoes.  Make sure to replace your shoes every 300 miles.</li>
    <li><strong>Increase mileage slowly: </strong>Increase mileage one mile at a time.  Doing otherwise will put you at risk for serious injury.</li>
    <li><strong>Give yourself days off: </strong>Doing anything everyday of the week is the fastest way to reach burn out and the surest way to risk injury. Running is no exception.</li>
    <li><strong>stretch: </strong>Make sure to stretch before and after running.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here's how your running shoes should fit: Wiggle Room - You should have about a thumb's width of room between the end of your longest toe and the front of the shoe. Hold It - Look for a secure, comfortable fit through the midfoot. Imagine a hand gently holding your foot in place.   
      <h3>Newtons</h3>
      <p>A great shoe for forefoot runners. These shoes are designed to keep you from heel striking.  They are lightweight and very breathable.  The only pitfall is they may cause blistering in peculiar areas such as on your forefoot.</p>

      <h3>Asics</h3> 
      <p>A great shoe for mid foot strikers.  These shoes are generally durable, making them slightly heftier than the average shoe.  The pricetag is also not bad at around 100$ a pair.</p>
